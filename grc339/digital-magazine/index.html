                                    On a night of glory for him and his team, Thomas Tuchel applied the final brush strokes to his renaissance masterpiece, 
                                    out-manoeuvring his friend and rival, Pep Guardiola, and watching Kai Havertz score the decisive goal just before half-time.

                                    that the plan to create a breakaway league was not a coup but a way to save the football industry.
